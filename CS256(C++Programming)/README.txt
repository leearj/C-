# Project Description

  - EX1:	HelloWorld
	AgeArithmatic (basic IO)
  
  - EX2: 
	Change: Given user's input 0~99cents, calculate how many coins(cents,quarter,dime,nickel,penny) it requires. Copy (basic IO): read a file and count how many char it has.
          
  - EX3:
	Printing out the shape(see ex3.pdf for detail)
  
  - EX4:
	3D Allocation / Delallocation

  - EX5:
	Familiarization with C++ operators, and dealing with fractions.

  - EX6:
	Similar as EX5.	

  - EX7:
	Conway game(The Game of Life).

  - EX9:
	Simulate the Chromosome(refer the ex9.pdf) which mutates and crossover. The syntax is similar as EX5 and EX6.

  - HW2:
	Calculate the sum / mean / Standard Deviation of the passed array.

  - HW3:
	CrazyLanguage: Writing an interpreter/compiler for our own programming language which will only have 8 different symbols, each corresponding to a different command. 

  - HW4:
	Polynomial: creating a class that handles polynomials of a variable x.

  - HW5(final project):
	Creating a simple game that simulate gravity and elastic collision on solid objects and draw them using SDL2 library.
